Project Summary
---------------
In this project, we were required to complete the code for a Tic-Tac-Toe game. The source code of the game GUI and logic was provided <a href = "https://github.com/udacity/ud282" title = "GitHub project code for Java"> here</a>. The code needed to be completed to test all the rows, columns and diagonals for a winner and announcing a winner or a tie. <br>
The <i> checkGameWinner() </i> function in <i> Game.java </i> is implemented to detect the game winner.
